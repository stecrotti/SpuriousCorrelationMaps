A small project i'm doing to learn some basics of:
- Data manipulation: gather data from various sources, clean it, transform it, visualize it
- Web app deployment: some quick-and-dirty essentials to share a simple app to the world

*Note*: the project is far from being done. The repo is public just because public GitHub repos can be synced to other services.
